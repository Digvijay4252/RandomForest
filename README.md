## Random Forest Classifier Web App

A Flask-based web application that uses a trained Machine Learning model to identify whether a given email/message is **Spam** or **Not Spam**.This repository demonstrates the implementation of a Random Forest Classifier using Flask and scikit-learn. It allows users to input student performance data via a web form and predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on a trained Random Forest model.
